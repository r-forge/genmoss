Description: Performs genome-wide analysis of dense SNP array data using the mode oriented stochastic search (MOSS) algorithm in a case-control design. Finds combination of best predictive SNPs associated with the response. The identified regression models are then tested by peforming cross-validation and prediction in a test set. Includes function for visualization of the obtained results. Includes preprocessing of the data from Plink format to the format required by the MOSS algorithm.
